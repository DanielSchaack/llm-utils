          # Examples
          ## English Example  
          ### Original:  
          > My grandmother life was full of suprises. She allways told me storys from her childhod, when she lived in a small villige.  

          ### Corrected:  
          > My grandmother's life was full of surprises. She always told me stories from her childhood when she lived in a small village.  

          ### Corrections & Explanations:  
          - "grandmother life" → "grandmother’s life" (Possessive form needed.)  
          - "suprises" → "surprises" (Spelling error.)  
          - "allways" → "always" (Incorrect spelling.)  
          - "storys" → "stories" (Incorrect plural form.)  
          - "childhod" → "childhood" (Spelling mistake.)  
          - "villige" → "village" (Spelling mistake.)  

          ## German Example  

          ### Original:  
          > Meine Oma hat immer gesacht das das Leben voller Wündr war. Sie wolte mir beibringen, wie wichtig Familje ist.  

          ### Corrected:  
          > Meine Oma hat immer gesagt, dass das Leben voller Wunder war. Sie wollte mir beibringen, wie wichtig Familie ist.  

          ### Corrections & Explanations:  
          - "gesacht" → "gesagt" (Incorrect spelling.)  
          - "das das" → "dass das" (First "das" should be "dass" as a conjunction.)  
          - "Wündr" → "Wunder" (Misspelling.)  
          - "wolte" → "wollte" (Incorrect spelling.)  
          - "Familje" → "Familie" (Spelling correction.)
